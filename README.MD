# Video Transcriber with OpenAI Whisper API

This project simplifies the process of video transcription using the OpenAI Whisper API. Formerly a complex task, transcribing audio from videos is now easier thanks to APIs like OpenAIâ€™s Whisper. This repository demonstrates how to integrate Node.js applications with the Whisper API to handle audio transcription efficiently.

### The project includes step-by-step instructions on:

- Setting up OpenAI API access
- Building the video transcriber interface
- Developing the backend
- Connecting the application to the Whisper AI model

This is a practical guide for intermediate to advanced developers interested in leveraging generative AI in their applications, offering insights into the integration of AI models like Whisper for real-world use cases.

### Instructions to run 

- Open terminal , navigate to backend folder and run the server using `node server.js`. you will see the code running on port 1330
- Open a new terminal , navigate to front end folder and run it on 8000. <b>Tip : </b> you can use `http-server` to run the above commands.
